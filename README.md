# English in Messenger

Learn English using the Facebook Messenger!

This is a bot that aims to teach English vocabulary (for now). Currently only targeted to people who want to learn English from Portuguese, it focuses on the [false friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_friend) between the two languages.

> Note: it is still in its early development process, but it should have some basic functionalities working soon.

## How it works

In the future, I intend to leave a description of how this bot works here.
